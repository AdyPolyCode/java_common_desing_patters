### Creational
Creational design patterns are concerned with object creation mechanisms. They provide different ways to instantiate objects, aiming to improve flexibility, maintainability, and control over object creation
- Builder: Aims to make object creation less complex, usually used when constructor parameters are getting too long.
- Singleton: Aims to make object creation durable as only one instance is available using this pattern.
- Prototype: Aims to make object creation memory efficient when creating one could be time consuming, it ensures object creation of same instance is more convenient with the help of cloning.
- Factory: Aims to decouple the creation to concrete classes, only knows about some parameters and from which specific objects are being created.
